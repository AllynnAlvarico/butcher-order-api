## Project Description

This is a full-stack ordering and management system for Thomas Hayes Butchers in Bray. 
The backend is a Spring Boot API with a MySQL database that handles customers, products, orders, and order items. On top of that backend, there will be two separate frontends:
- **Admin / Business side:** Angular + Tailwind, focused on day‑to‑day operations (managing products, tracking orders, and viewing basic analytics).
- **Customer side:** React, providing a simple web ordering experience that replaces phone calls and handwritten notes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend – Admin / Business**
  - Angular (SPA framework for dashboards and management screens)
  - Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling for fast UI layout)  

- **Frontend – Customer**
  - React (customer web ordering interface)

- **Backend**
  - Java 21  
  - Spring Boot (Web, Data JPA, Validation)
  - MySQL (relational database)
  - Maven (build and dependency management)  

- **Tools & DevOps**
  - Postman (API testing)  
  - Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration) 
  - IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code (IDE for backend and frontends)

## Personal Idea and Experience

I recently visited Thomas Hayes Butchers in Bray, watched how they handled orders, and spoke with one of the staff about their current process. 
I noticed that a lot of orders are still taken over the counter or by phone and written down on paper, which can be stressful during busy times 
and makes it harder to track demand or spot mistakes. That conversation gave me the idea to design a simple ordering system and 
I asked for permission to build a personal project around their workflow and potentially present it to them later.

For me, this project is mainly about learning how to apply technology to real business problems, not just building another demo app. 
I want to understand how a small, family-style shop actually operates and how a modern tech stack (React, Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL) 
can support them without getting in the way of their personal service. It is also something I plan to include on my CV as a concrete example of turning an observed business issue into a working technical solution. 
This project is a collaboration with a college classmate, so it also reflects how we work together to design the database, API endpoints, and overall flow for a real-world scenario.
